 A very simple quiz application using React.js

You can view and try out the quiz here: https://blake-gilmore.github.io/Cybersecurity-Quiz-App

This quiz is a simple multiple-choice format for questions that are helpful while studying for the COMPTIA Security+ exam. The quiz is separated into the five skill areas that CompTIA focuses on for its Security+ exam: 
<ul>
<li>Attacks, Threats and Vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Architecture and Design</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Operations and Incident Response</li>
<li>Governance, Risk and Compliance</li>
</ul>

You will be prompted for how many questions from the list we have you would like to be asked. You can put any number below the maximum amount per category, and it will shuffle all the questions. As of now, the quiz's functionality will only report the number of questions you've gotten right or wrong at the end, and you can restart the process from there.
